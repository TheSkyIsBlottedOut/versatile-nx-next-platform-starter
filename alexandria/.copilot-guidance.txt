VPCS is a useful CLI tool, and should be used when possible. If it isn't running, the PATH variable
is not properly set and the user should `source .envrc` or `direnv allow` to fix this.

As NextJS is in flux, some libraries reimplement MDN functionality lost in translation. For instance,
the api-helper and classy libs both include stream-to-json files for reading client bodies. classy
also provides client-side access to context through direct manipulation of localStorage and sessionstorage.

The globalcontext object ($.client.globalctx) accesses the localStorage global context, a base64 encoded
json string. This stores short-term data for the client to understand context.

Tailwind libraries are currently building the global styles into public/compiled.css, which is included
in the site layout. Webpack should not use eval mode, as it will trigger security errors.

Browser and session cookies are written by the next.config.mjs file. This site is hosted at palm.iswork.in.

Authentication is provided via an SOA where concerto (mostly in the prerelease-concerto branch) accesses the
database directly.

Most of the site's goals involve translating business data into several form prefills, and so the different
structures available from the concerto backend should be mapped (via the valuation library) to interface/type
structures in the frontend.

We should *always* set the user and auth cookies; it's easy to pull data from the backend.
